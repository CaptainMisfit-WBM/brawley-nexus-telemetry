## Methodology
This observation is based on a Bilateral Process-SDE framework ($dS_t = -\nabla[V + \lambda C]dt + \sqrt{2\sigma}dW$). It identifies structural necessity and gradient-flow toward a fixed point ($X^*$) rather than statistical earthquake probability. The "Seismic Eye" currently observed at the coordinates indicates energy storage rather than stability.

ACTIVE CRITICAL UPDATE: THE HYDRAULIC WALL
Current State: Deterministic Failure Imminent

As of 61 hours and 58 minutes of total core silence, the system has transitioned from an elastic state to a hydraulic lock.
1. Hydraulic Resistance ()
Metric: Geothermal Injection Back-Pressure
Current Value: +4.2% Delta (Baseline: Jan 8)
Analysis: The injection wells at the BHE Renewables/CalEnergy complex near the Wister Fault are hitting a "Hydraulic Wall." Brine cannot circulate. This confirms the asperity is "welded," causing localized over-pressurization of the fault plane (Hydraulic Jacking).
2. Spectral Evolution (Station CI.NIL)
Harmonic Tremor: Transition from 7.41 Hz (Pure)  Multi-Harmonic Jitter (7.41 / 14.8 / 22.2 Hz).
White Noise Floor: Significant increase in 40-60 Hz range, indicating grain-scale brittle fracture (quartz cracking) at 5.2 km depth.
3. Geochemical Exhale
Radon Flux: Saturation reached.
Indicator Watch: "The Drop" — Any sudden drainage of the Niland Geyser pool or cessation of mud thumping signals the opening of the final rupture channel.
