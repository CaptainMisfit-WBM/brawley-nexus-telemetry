## Methodology
This observation is based on a Bilateral Process-SDE framework ($dS_t = -\nabla[V + \lambda C]dt + \sqrt{2\sigma}dW$). It identifies structural necessity and gradient-flow toward a fixed point ($X^*$) rather than statistical earthquake probability. The "Seismic Eye" currently observed at the coordinates indicates energy storage rather than stability.
